1) So here we want to develop a new static website and for this we are going to make use of a open source
    tool named as gatsby
    https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/
    So from this site we are going to install this gatsby tool and since it is a npm tool hence we will be using below
    commands
    a) # npm install -g gatsby-cli
    b) Then we will crate new website
        # gatsby new static-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
        "static-site" is a website name 
    c) Now lets go inside the static-site
        # cd /d/software/gatsby_static_site/static-site
    d) The start the local development server and that can be done by using below command
        # gatsby develop
        This will bring up our local http server to host this static site and we can open that site in our browser
        using ==> http://localhost:8000/
        This will open up the hello world page.
2) Now that we have created out project in our local machine we are going to mirror the same on gitlab as well
3) So lets got to the gitlab
    https://gitlab.com/
    and click on new project
    give the name of a project as "My statis website"
    give the description and click on create project
4) Now as soon as new project is created on gitlab we can push the project on our local machine at below location
    to the gitlab
    location of local Git repo for static website project
    /d/software/gatsby_static_site/static-site
    # cd /d/software/gatsby_static_site/static-site
    if we will check the status og git here we will see we are currently working with clean git repo and we don't
    have to do anything to setup local repo. 
    we just have to do is to add the remote repo to our local repo.
    # git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/sagsh018/my-static-website.git
    Then we can just push our local repo to gitlab using below push command
    # git push -u origin master.
