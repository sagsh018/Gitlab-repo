1) So here we are going to take a look how to use the pre defined environment variables when using gitlab-ci
2) Gitlab comes with lot of predefined environment variables that we can use. Below is a link which has all the information
    about the pre defined environment variables.
    https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html
3) For example, one of the pre defined environment variable could be "CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA" which basically gives the first
    8 digits of the hash generated to identify the commit. so with the help of this we can easily identify which commit
    is responsible for the current version of the website on internet.
4) Let go ahead and include this Pre defined environment variable("CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA") and try to embed version number
     in our website
     Below are the steps that need to be takes in order to use this predefined environment variable
     a) First we will make modifications in our build step of the pipeline, because this is a place where the website
        is built and artifacts are uploaded
     b) So firstly we will display the value for this predefined env variable using below command as part of script in
        build step
        echo $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
     c) Second this to notice is, there is a file named as index.js which is at the following locations
        D:\software\gatsby_static_site\static-site\src\pages\index.js
        and it has following content after modifications
        ======================================================================
        import React from "react"

        export default function Home() {
            return <div>Hello world! This is commit number %%VERSION%%</div>
        }
        ======================================================================
        Now this is the java script file which is reponsible to create the index.html website page in our project folder
        ./public.
        and as we have introduce a kind of marker inside index.js file, so when this JS file create the index.html after 
        "gatsby build" step, its going to have same marker in that file as well.
        but then we are using sed command in order to replace this %%VERSION%% marker in index.html file with the commit
        hash using our pre defined environment variable
        sed -i "s/%%VERSION%%/$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA/" ./public/index.html
        save the index.js file after modifications and also the gitlab-ci file which looks like as below
        =================================================================
        image: node

        stages:
            - build
            - test
            - deploy
            - testdeploy

        Build Website:
            stage: build
            script:
                - echo $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
                - npm install
                - npm install -g gatsby-cli
                - gatsby build
                - sed -i "s/%%VERSION%%/$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA/" ./public/index.html
            artifacts:
                paths:
                - ./.cache
                - ./public
                - ./node_modules
  
        Test Artifact:
            image: alpine
            stage: test
            script:
                - grep -q "Hello world!" ./public/index.html

        Test Website:
            stage: test
            script:
                - npm install 
                - npm install -g gatsby-cli
                - nohup gatsby serve &
                - sleep 6
                - curl "http://localhost:9000" | grep -q "Hello world!"

        Deploy Website:
            stage: deploy
            script:
                - npm install -g surge 
                - surge --project ./public --domain digitapadwa.surge.sh

        Test Deploy:
            image: alpine
            stage: testdeploy
            script:
                - apk add curl 
                - curl http://digitapadwa.surge.sh/ | grep -q "Hello world!"
        ===================================================================================
        one thing to notice here is that since we have not modified the same data in all the javascript files, so this
        version data will appear on the website just for couple of seconds and after that it will be displayed as
        %%VERSION%%
        This can be corrected after correcting the configuration completely
5) Now lets do one more step and test our version as well as part of testing the website
    Test Deploy:
        image: alpine
        stage: testdeploy
        script:
            - apk add curl 
            - curl http://digitapadwa.surge.sh/ | grep -q "Hello world!"
            - curl http://digitapadwa.surge.sh/ | grep -q "$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA"
    So this last line added is pert of testing the environment variable
