1) So here we want to develop a new static website and for this we are going to make use of a open source
    tool named as gatsby
    https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/
    So from this site we are going to install this gatsby tool and since it is a npm tool hence we will be using below
    commands
    a) # npm install -g gatsby-cli
    b) Then we will crate new website
        # gatsby new static-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
        "static-site" is a website name
