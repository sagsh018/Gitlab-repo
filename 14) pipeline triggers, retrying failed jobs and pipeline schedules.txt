1) In this lecture we are going to have a look at the pipeline triggers, how we can retry the failed jobs and how we 
    can start the pipeline without doing any commit.
2) Suppose you pipeline consist of 4 jobs and the last job has failed after completing rest of the jobs succssfully.
    So there is no need to start the pipeline all over again, we can give is a retry to that last failed job by using the 
    retry button with every job on the pipeline page.
    Same goes with the pipeline as well.
    on the pipeline page there is a symbol of retrying the pipeline on the right had side correspinding to the pipeline.
3) There could be a case when we want to run the pipeline without performing any commit or changeing any code.
    on the main page of the project, mclick on the pipeline option from the lefthand side pane and on the pipeline page
    on the right most top corner there is a button called as "Run Pipeline"
    on this page you can select the branch against which you want to run the pipeline and also you can provide some 
    variables if you want  and click on run pipeline at the end of page.
4) Consider another senerio, where you want to schedule the pipeline run.
    on the main page of project, go to left pane, under CI/CD option there is a option of schedules. Click on schedules,
    This will take you to the schedule page
    on schedule page click on "New Schedule", and provide the branch information and also the timing information by using
    available options or by using cron expressions.
    You can also give the description as well
    then click on save pipeline schedule at the end of page.
