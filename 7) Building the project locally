1) So far we have installed gatsby and created our project locally and manage to start the local development server
    which has started our local website
2) But we can't send this localyy created project to peoduction system. So there is a step required in order to make
    this local project production ready and that will be build process.
    Build step
    ==========
    a) Most of the projects have a production build step
    b) Developers write code in human readable programming language (like C, Java, Ruby, Javascript), but this needs to
        be compiled to make it ready for deployment
    c) The source code need to be further processed in order to make deployment ready to production  server
    Gatsby Build Step
    =================
    a) produces static HTML javascripts files
    b) CSS/javascripts files are merged and compressed in order to reduce the the website download size
    c) Command
        # gatsby build
        This is going to create another folder inside static-site folder named as "public"
        and if we notice few last steps of the above build Command
            =================================================================
            success Building production JavaScript and CSS bundles - 13.041s
            success Rewriting compilation hashes - 0.004s
            success Building static HTML for pages - 1.106s - 1/1 0.90/s
            =================================================================
        These steps shows what processing is done in build steps related to javascripts and css files are compiled and
        bundle is created and static HTML pages are built as well
        So this creates our production read
    d) Lets go inside public folder
        # cd /d/software/gatsby_static_site/static-site/public
        This contain files like index.html and all the java scripts and CSS file in order to create a website   
        So is nothing but what is called as "artifact"
        We can store this artifact some where in artifact repository like nexus and then use it from there in order to
        deploy our static website.
        
Note 
====
We have docker container used in gitlab ci in order to have small virtual machine image to spin up complete our task
and then get destroyed
so in order to test our project we can simply get one such docker container using gitlab ci and get node.js installed
along with the gatsby and get the website hosted for testing.
we will follow this technique in later lectures.
