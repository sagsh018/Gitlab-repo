1) So till now we have our static website built and tested successfully. Now we want to deply it somewhere
2) We are going to make use of "surge" in order to deploy our website
    SURGE 
    ======
    It is used for static web publishing for front-end Developers
    It is simple, single-command web publishing. it publish the HTML, CSS, and JS for free, without leaving the command line.
    What is surge.sh 
    ================
    a) Cloud plateform for serverless deployment
    b) Easy to use and configure
    c) Simple deployment process
    d) Ideal for static websites
3) So in order to use surge on our local system we have to do couple of steps.
    a) We should be having node.js installed. Which we already have under D:\software location.
    b) Install surge by using npm install 
        # npm install -g surge 
        notice we are going to install this in below location
        /d/software/gatsby_static_site/static-site/public
    c) once it is installed we can just type below command to enter surge console
        # surge
        This is going to ask us the email and password in order to create account
        email : ss0315345@gmail.com
        password : Ishwarusmay19922005
        Then is is going to ask us the project location, we are going to select below location
            D:\software\gatsby_static_site\static-site\public\
        Hit enter
        Then it is going to give us the domain address through which we can access our website
        shaky-art.surge.sh
        Hit enter again
        And thats all, it has pblished our site on "shaky-art.surge.sh"
        we can open this Domain in our web browser in order to see our static site
