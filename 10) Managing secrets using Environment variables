1) In this lecture we are going to see how to manage the secrets, when we are uging gitlab
2) As we so not want tokeep any secrets, credentials, usernames in our pipelines or project files.
3) With Gitlab-ci, we can define Environment variables that will be available when running the pipelines
4) Environment variables are ideal for storing the secrets when working with gitlab ci

Now our main goal is to to be able to use Gitlab-ci in order to deploy the website to surge
As we have seen in previous lecture we were able to deploy our website somewhere in cloud easily with the help of surge,
by giving the email and password details along with the project location.

But during Gitlab ci run this type of interactive session won't be available, and we won't be able to give our email and
credentials at the time of pipeline run. Also we would not like to use our username and password while doing such deployments
in pipelines 

So instead of using the username/email and password to such type of tools as surge we use tokens, which are inturn created
with the help of username and passwords only in order to login to surge and do the deployment. but with the token, the
benefit is that, we can revoke it after the deployment, so you are again safe without compromising and changing your password

So first lets go to the surge console and generate the token
# surge token
    2e3f454477be81b6bc9ad509aaa7c612
Now lets go to our gitlab, and try to save this secrete
Open to main project page and from the left side options, choose settings> CI/CD > Variables ==> expand them and then
click on new variable. then in the pop up fill in the details for two variables
SURGE_LOGIN ==> ss0315345@gmail.com
SURGE_TOKEN ==> 2e3f454477be81b6bc9ad509aaa7c612
So once you save these variables, you won't be able to see them untill you click on Reveal values button next to new
variable button.
Ans these Environment variables will be later availabe when we will be running th jobs.
